### Primary Roles
* Alex Oesterling:
    - Wrote Runner and Application class which integrate Modeling, Configuration, and Visualization components into the total simulation application. 
    These classes contain the UI element of the project, including all buttons, sliders, and menus aside from simulation-specific parameter fields
    which the user interacts with. Wrote Visualizer class which takes data from Grid class and uses this data to render a visualization of
    the scene, as well as generating the graph of cell populations and the simulation-specific parameter-tuning text fields. This visualizer passes
    its generated nodes to the Application for placing in the stage along with the general UI controls
